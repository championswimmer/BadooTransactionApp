/**
 * This class implements the a currency converter.
 * Because not every exchange rate is directly defined, the basis data structure is an
 * unweighted, directed graph, with strings as vertices and edges holding the exchange rate.
 *    SimpleDirectedGraph<String, Double>
 * Final exchange rates are computed using Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm.
 *
 * a) In realistic cases, paths between currencies should be relatively small (max 2,3 edges),
 * so that no major performance issues should exist (application dependent).
 * If that is the case, a possibility straightforward improvement could be made by
 * using a cache structure, e.g of type TreeMap< String, TreeMap< String, Double> >, where all
 * possible exchange rates are precomputed and stored.
 * It would be updated every time the graph is changed.
 *
 * b) The class is not yet thread-safe. As soon as a concrete application where that is an issue,
 * the issue will be addressed.
 *
 * c) Vertices are String because of the initial definition of the problem. Ideally, however, one
 * could use java.util.Currency, which implements ISO-4217
